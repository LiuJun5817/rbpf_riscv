Solana RISC-V JIT Compiler

## Overview

The project aims to develop a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the Solana blockchain that targets the RISC-V architecture. The goal is to optimize Solana's smart contract execution engine (using eBPF) by leveraging RISC-Vâ€™s open-source nature and powerful processing capabilities. This project will improve Solana's performance on RISC-V-based hardware, especially in scenarios requiring high computational efficiency, low-latency processing, and more hardware flexibility.
